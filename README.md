VR/AR Effects on Human Brain - Medical Research

Overview

A comprehensive neurobiological analysis examining how Virtual Reality (AR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies affect the human brain across psychological, physiological, and biological domains.

Key Research Areas

· Psychological Effects: Cognitive function, attention, emotional processing, and therapeutic applications
· Physiological Impacts: Brain structure changes, neural activity patterns, and autonomic responses
· Biological Changes: Neuroplasticity, neurotransmitter responses, and long-term adaptations
· Clinical Applications: Anxiety disorders, cognitive rehabilitation, pain management, and neurological conditions
· Safety Profile: Short-term and long-term effects, side effects, and tolerability

Methodology

· Analysis of 285+ peer-reviewed studies including meta-analyses and clinical trials
· Focus on validated outcome measures and neuroimaging data
· Examination of both acute exposure and long-term interventions

Significance

This research provides evidence-based insights into how immersive technologies can be leveraged for therapeutic applications while understanding potential risks and neurobiological mechanisms.
